*A food menu is a list or a board that displays the different food and drink items that a restaurant or a food establishment offers. The menu typically includes the names of the dishes, their descriptions, and their prices. Some menus may also indicate the ingredients, cooking methods, or nutritional information of the dishes. A well-designed food menu should be easy to read, visually appealing, and reflect the restaurant's brand and style. In addition to its practical purpose of informing customers about the available food options, a food menu can also serve as a marketing tool, enticing customers to try new dishes or promoting special deals and promotions.*
